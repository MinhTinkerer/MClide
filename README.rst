Description
===========

A command-line style communication interface designed to make it easy to send messages and
data between two micro-controllers, a microcontroller and computer, or two computers, via
a serial interface that supports ASCII characters (e.g. UART, I2C, SPI).

Two functionally identical Clide projects exist, this one written in C++ for an embedded system,
and the other one (Cs-Clide) written in C# for running on a PC.

Uses a both human readable and computer readable format (POSIX.2 command-line style, with
GNU extensions) for easy implementation and debugging. 
Automatically generates UNIX-style help text
which is useful if system is being controlled by a human (see below).

Useful for working with and controlling embedded systems.

An example message takes the format of

::

	set-speed -rpm 2000\n

where set-speed is the command name, "-rpm" is an optional argument that specifies
that the value is in rpm, "2000" is a non-optional parameter which specifies the
speed, and "\n" is the new-line character which signifies the end of a message
(which is normally inserted automatically by command-lines when enter is pressed).

Another which uses long options is:

::

	on --led1==on

Uses dynamic memory allocation for creating commands/options/parameters e.t.c
Command data is stored in a contiguous block

All text is case-sensitive. It is recommended to use lower-case only to
follow the POSIX command-line style.

Special support for the "help" command, and `-h`, `--help` flags for every registered
command. No special support other UNIX commands such as `man`, `whatis` or `info`
'help' is a special command which can be implemented by calling RegisterHelpCmd().

Supports long options (GNU extension to the POSIX.2 standard).


External Dependencies
=====================
- <stdio.h> 	-> snprintf()
- <stdlib.h> 	-> realloc(), malloc(), calloc(), free()
- <cctype>		-> isalnum()
- <getopt.h>	-> getopt_long()

Packet Decoding Process (RX)
============================

When Rx.Run() is called...

- Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the start of the packet
- Split packet into separate arguments
- Make sure received command is registered. If so, set cmdReceived = TRUE. It not, return FALSE.
- Extract options and values (if present), execute option callback functions
- Check all parameters are present
- Execute parameter callback functions
- Execute command callback function

Issues
======

See GitHub Issues.

Limitations
===========

- Maximum number of commands: 256
- Maximum number of parameters or options per command: 256
- Maximum string length of a command name, option name/value, parameter value: clideMAX_STRING_LENGTH

Usage
=====


**Includes**

::

	using namespace Clide;

**Clide Objects**

::
	
	// Create RX Clide object
	Clide::Rx rxController;
	
**Callback Functions**

::
	
	// Create call-back function that is automatically called when
	// registered command is recieved
	bool SetSpeedCmd(Clide::Cmd* cmd)
	{
		// Extract parameter from received command
		float speed = atof(cmd->paramA[0]->value);
		
		// Call some function to do stuff with parameter
		Motor.SetSpeed(speed);
	}
	
	// Create call-back function for help command. The help functionality
	// is automatically provided by calling rxController.PrintHelp()
	// (prints help info to the command line, if being controlled
	// by a human).
	bool HelpCmd(Cmd* cmd)
	{
		#if(PRINT_DEBUG_COMMS_INTERFACE == 1)
			UartDebug::PutString("COMMS: Help command received.\r\n");
		#endif

		rxController.PrintHelp();

		return true;
	}
	
**Main Loop**

::
	
	int main()
	{
		// Create Parameter
		Param speed("The desired speed.");
		// Create command
		Cmd setSpeedCmd("set-speed", &SetSpeedCmd, "Sets the speed.");
		// Register parameter with command
		setSpeedCmd.RegisterParam(&speed);
		// Register command with RX (can also be registered with TX controller if desired).
		rxController.RegisterCmd(&setVelocityCmd);
		
		// Register help command
		Cmd help("help", &HelpCmd, "Prints help info.");
		rxController.RegisterCmd(&help);
		
		// Infinite loop
		for(;;)
		{
			char rxChar;						//!< Memory to hold incoming character
			
			// Wait indefinetly for byte to be received on rx queue of the comms UART (blocking)
			UartComms::GetChar(&rxChar);
			
			if( rxChar == '\r' )
			{
				// Line of text has been entered
				
				// Send command to Clide
				rxController.Run((char*)rxBuffer);

				// Clear the input string ready 
				// to receive the next command.
				rxBufferPos = 0;
				memset(rxBuffer, 0x00, sizeof(rxBuffer));
				
				// Clear tx buffer also
				memset(txBuffer, 0x00, sizeof(txBuffer));
				
			}
			else
			{
				// A character was entered.  It was not a new line so it is
				// placed into the input buffer.  When \n is detected,
				// the complete string will be passed to Clide.
				if( rxBufferPos < sizeof(rxBuffer))
				{
					rxBuffer[rxBufferPos] = rxChar;
					rxBufferPos++;
				}
				else
				{
					UartDebug::PutString("COMMS: Maximum input string length reached.\r\n");
				}
			}
		}
	}
	
**Port Specific Code**

::

	// Fill in port-specific code in template functions in Clide-Port.c
	CmdLinePrint(){ ... }
	DebugPrint(){ ... }

Version  Date       Comment
======== ========== ===================================================================================================
v2.1.1.0 2013/07/09 Fixed non-portable use of '%u' in snprintf() in Rx::ValidateCmd(). Fixed other non-portable uses of snprint() and added more port-specific defines in Clide-Port.h. Removed RX code from Clide::Tx class. Added double braces around initialisers for two Rx::Run() variables. Changed optint to (optint - 1) when printing option which caused '?' to be returned from getopt_long(). Added unit tests for quotes and negative numbers.
v2.1.0.0 2013/07/09 Added unit tests for multiple Clide::Rx.Run() calls (ClideTest-MultipleRxRunCalls.cpp). Fixed long option index bug in Rx::BuildLongOptionStruct(). Fixed bug in getopt_long() reporting incorrect options by setting optint = 0 before run (explained in getopt.h). Fixed bug in Rx::ValidateOption() variable 'val' being initialised to 0, which was what was checked for after calling strcmp to see if there was a match.
v2.0.0.0 2013/07/08 Long options are now supported in the command-line interface (now used getopt_long). Various code to Option class and RX decoding has been added/changed to support this. Added Clide-Global.h. Deleted internal dependency section in README (not useful). Added mention of POSIX.2 standard in README. Fixed unit test that was failing (strcpy() was being passed a NULL). Added new Makefile option clean-ut, which just cleans the unit test code. Added unit tests for long options.
v1.6.4.0 2013/07/05 Added 'SpasticInput' unit tests. Added Doxygen '@brief' tags to documentation in `Clide-Cmd.h`. Added more documentation. Added C++ check to Clide-Port.cpp. Added port-specific code for PSoC5/5LP `printf()` functions in `Clide-Port.hpp`. Renamed namespace in Clide-MemMang from 'MemMang' to 'Clide'. Put MemMang functions inside a class. Added unit tests for commands with both parameters and options. 1 unit test currently failing.
v1.6.3.0 2013/07/05 Grouped all unit tests into test suites.
v1.6.2.0 2013/07/05 Re-added argsPtr assignment which was removed in last commit and caused Rx.Run() to crash on every call.
v1.6.1.0 2013/07/05 Added destructor debug messages. Add macro to enable/disable automatic help generation. Removed static global variables in Rx class and put them in Rx.Run() instead. This fixed the issues with some of the unit tests failing.
v1.6.0.0 2013/07/04 Deleted un-needed @public and @private comments. Put public objects first in classes. Added cmdDetected variable to Cmd object, and info about it to README. Formatted all-caps section titles in README correctly. Made Makefile file finding more automatic. Added more unit test files. Removed port-specific UartDebug function calls. Added destructor for Cmd object that frees up allocated memory. Renamed MemMang and PowerString-Split libraries to be part of Clide.
v1.5.0.0 2013/07/04 Added first unit tests (3 of them). They run automatically when 'make all' is called.
v1.4.1.0 2013/07/04 Fixed the '.h' includes to '.hpp'. Fixed 'make clean', it is now removing the correct files.
v1.4.0.0 2013/07/04 Renamed all .c files to .cpp and .h to .hpp. Automated some of the file finding processes in the Makefile.
v1.3.0.1 2013/07/03 Forgot to save README.rst.
